Key-Value File System:

Developed a key/value le system that utilizes raw and direct I/O operations on a block
device. Deployed the system on a loop-back device ensuring that implementation
avoids reliance on kernel buffers for both reading and writing by incorporating efcient
write buffering and read caching mechanisms to optimize performance
